# Migration Plan: ShaderDemo Refactoring

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the current monolithic `shader_demo_impl.dart` file to the new refactored architecture.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Preparation

- ✅ Create all new files and ensure they compile without errors
- ✅ Verify that all dependencies are correctly imported
- ✅ Add comprehensive documentation to help other developers understand the refactoring

### 2. Testing Before Migration

- ✅ Perform analysis to identify any issues
- [ ] Create unit tests for critical functionality in the new components
- [ ] Implement integration tests that verify the end-to-end behavior

### 3. Gradual Migration

#### Phase 1: Use Services Behind the Scenes
- ✅ Import new service classes in the original implementation
- ✅ Replace direct code with calls to service methods
- ✅ Verify functionality is unchanged

#### Phase 2: Update Import References
- ✅ Update the `index.dart` file to expose the new implementation
- ✅ Test that other parts of the app correctly use the new exports

#### Phase 3: Switch to New Implementation
- ✅ Create a backup of the original implementation as `shader_demo_impl.original.dart`
- ✅ Replace `shader_demo_impl.dart` with our refactored version
- ✅ Verify all functionality is working correctly

### 4. Cleanup

- ✅ Ensure all imports are correctly updated
- ✅ Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
- [ ] Address linting warnings and informational issues
- [ ] Remove any unused code or files

## Rollback Plan

In case issues are discovered during migration:

1. Revert the file rename by copying `shader_demo_impl.original.dart` back to `shader_demo_impl.dart`
2. Restore original imports in `index.dart`
3. Remove any new service calls from the original implementation
4. Document the specific issues encountered for future resolution
