# Shader Demo Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring approach for the ShaderDemo implementation, which was previously a single file of over 1800 lines.

## Architecture

The refactored implementation follows a clean architecture approach:

1. **Models** - Data structures that represent app state
2. **Services** - Handle business logic and external interactions
3. **Controllers** - Manage UI state and coordinate services
4. **Views** - Reusable UI components
5. **Widgets** - Smaller UI building blocks

## File Structure

### State Management
- `state/shader_demo_state.dart` - Centralized state management for the shader demo

### Services
- `services/asset_service.dart` - Handles loading image assets and music tracks
- `services/preset_service.dart` - Manages preset operations (save, update, cleanup)

### Controllers
- `controllers/slideshow_controller.dart` - Manages the slideshow functionality
- `controllers/effect_controller.dart` - (existing) Manages shader effects
- `controllers/preset_controller.dart` - (existing) Handles preset CRUD operations
- `controllers/preset_dialogs.dart` - (existing) UI dialogs for preset operations

### Views
- `views/slideshow_view.dart` - View for displaying presets in slideshow mode
- `views/effect_controls.dart` - (existing) Controls for effect parameters
- `views/panel_container.dart` - (existing) Container for control panels
- `views/image_container.dart` - (existing) Container for displaying images
- `views/text_overlay.dart` - (existing) Text overlay component

### Utils
- `utils/logging_utils.dart` - (existing) Centralized logging functionality
- `utils/animation_utils.dart` - (existing) Animation utility functions

### Main Implementation
- `shader_demo_impl.dart` - Original (large) implementation file
- `shader_demo_impl_refactored.dart` - Refactored implementation that uses the new components

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability** - Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
2. **Better Code Organization** - Logical separation of concerns
3. **Enhanced Testability** - Individual components can be tested in isolation
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Developers can focus on one aspect at a time
5. **Easier Collaboration** - Multiple developers can work on different parts simultaneously

## Migration Approach

The refactoring was done by:
1. Extracting common functionality into dedicated service and utility classes
2. Moving UI components to separate view files
3. Creating a state management class to handle data flow
4. Implementing a new main file that orchestrates the components

This approach maintains all existing functionality while providing a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
